Summary
We developed a website focused on exoplanets, featuring five key sections: Home, News and Articles, Explore, Contact, and Quiz. The site introduces users to exoplanets, provides the latest space-related news, offers detailed information on various exoplanets, allows visitors to submit messages, and includes an interactive quiz to test knowledge. This project makes complex space exploration topics accessible and engaging, fostering public interest and understanding of exoplanets and their significance in the universe.
